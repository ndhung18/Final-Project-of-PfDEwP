### Introduction
This project focuses on scraping and analyzing user engagement data from a Facebook fan page using `python`, aiming to extract meaningful insights from social media interactions, such as user activity patterns and engagement trends, through data processing, cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

### Features
- **Data Scraping:** Used `facebook-scraper` to extract posts, comments, and reactions.
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Handled raw data with `pandas`, `glob`, `json` and `re` for organizing datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed the distribution of reactions, posting frequency, and the most frequently occurring keywords using `scikit-learn`
  
### Conclusion
This project enhanced my skills in data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. Analyzing Facebook data can significantly benefit content creators and marketers by providing insights into their audience and optimizing engagement strategies.
